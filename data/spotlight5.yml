    Tracking several objects from video recordings is a complicated image processing task but essential in many academic fields. We compiled a database of two-dimensional movies from very different biological and physical systems, spanning a wide range of scales and dynamics, and developed a general-purpose tracking software called FastTrack. It can handle a changing number of deformable objects. We demonstrated that FastTrack is orders of magnitudes faster than state-of-the-art tracking algorithms with comparable tracking accuracy. Chemical perception mediates several essential behaviors in fish, like mating and feeding. However, there is much to understand on how the fish process chemical stimuli. We build two experimental setups. Dual, a high-throughput setup capable of assessing young zebrafish chemical preference, and The Tropical River to simulate realistic flows that fish are susceptible to encounter in nature. Dual is scalable, open-source, and can be built for less than 2 000 euros.<br><b>Technology:</b> Computer vision, software design, setup construction, electronic, animal experiment.
